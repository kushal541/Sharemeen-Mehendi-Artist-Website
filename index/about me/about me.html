  <h2>BIOGRAPHY</h2>
  
 <P class="blocktext" style="text-align:justify">My name is Sharemeen Khan, and I am a 
  Mauritian henna artist working at le Caudan Warterfront, 
  Mauritius. I am someone who love drawing and painting using henna. 
  It all begins at the age of 11 years old where I started to develop 
  a passion for drawings. During my school time, I was always regular 
  in my art classes and have learn a lot of things such as ART history, 
  ART biographies, use of different mediums and techniques, 
  and explores ART in our everyday lives. After leaving school, 
  the only work I did which was not related to art was to work as 
  a shop supervisor in a company in Port Louis for about one and a 
  half year. After the company closed its door, I decided to focus 
  myself on what I do the best which is art. I started to try for 
  three months and saw that not only Mauritians people but also many 
  tourists were interested in henna. Then finally it became my business.</p>
